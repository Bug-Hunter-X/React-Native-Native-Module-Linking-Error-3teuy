The solution involves ensuring that the native modules are correctly linked within your project.  This typically requires checking the following:

1. **Android:** Verify that you've followed the library's instructions for adding the native module to your `android/app/build.gradle` file.  This often includes adding dependencies and potentially modifying other Gradle configuration files.

2. **iOS:** Make sure that you've added the necessary native code frameworks to your Xcode project (`ios/{YourProjectName}.xcodeproj`). You may need to drag and drop the libraries or manually edit the project files.

3. **Podfile (iOS):** Ensure your `Podfile` (located in the `ios` directory) is properly configured to include any required dependencies for your native modules. Run `pod install` after making changes to your `Podfile`.

4. **React Native Link (Deprecated):** While `react-native link` is deprecated, some libraries may still require manual linking steps if `react-native link` isn't fully supported. Refer to the library's documentation for explicit instructions.  

5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  After making changes, always clean your project and rebuild it for both platforms to ensure that the changes are reflected in the build process.

**Example (Illustrative - adapt to your specific library):**

// Incorrect (bug.js)
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

// Correct (bugSolution.js) (Illustrative - shows manual linking)
// Assuming you've completed the native module linking steps
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;
// ...rest of your code
