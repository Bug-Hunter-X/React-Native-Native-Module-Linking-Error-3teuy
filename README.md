# React Native Native Module Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native projects involving native module linking.  The issue arises when a library reliant on native modules fails to integrate correctly, causing runtime errors.

## Problem Description

The application might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior due to missing or incorrectly linked native modules. This frequently occurs during development when adding new third-party libraries that utilize native functionalities (e.g., camera access, Bluetooth communication).

## Solution

The solution usually involves verifying the native module linking process for both iOS and Android platforms.  This often includes manual linking steps and ensuring that the necessary native code is correctly compiled and integrated within the React Native project's architecture.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the setup instructions for both Android and iOS platforms within the respective platform directories.
3. Run the application on either platform (or both) and observe the error.
4. Compare the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files to understand the difference between the problematic code and the corrected code.

## Further Notes

This issue isn't always easy to debug, and the error messages can sometimes be vague. Careful examination of the build logs and the native module's documentation is crucial in resolving the problem.
